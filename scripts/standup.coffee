# Description:
#   Have Hubot remind you to do standups.
#   hh:mm must be in the same timezone as the server Hubot is on. Probably UTC.
#
#   This is configured to work for Hipchat. You may need to change the 'create standup' command
#   to match the adapter you're using.
#
# Configuration:
#  HUBOT_STANDUP_PREPEND
#
# Commands:
#   hubot standup help - See a help document explaining how to use.
#   hubot create standup hh:mm - Creates a standup at hh:mm every weekday for this room
#   hubot create standup hh:mm UTC+2 - Creates a standup at hh:mm every weekday for this room (relative to UTC)
#   hubot list standups - See all standups for this room
#   hubot list standups in every room - See all standups in every room
#   hubot delete hh:mm standup - If you have a standup at hh:mm, deletes it
#   hubot delete all standups - Deletes all standups for this room.
#
# Dependencies:
#   underscore
#   cron
